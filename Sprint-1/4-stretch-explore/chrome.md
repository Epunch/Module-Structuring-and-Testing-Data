Open a new window in Chrome,

then locate the **Console** tab.

Voila! You now have access to the [Chrome V8 Engine](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-chrome-v8/).
Just like the Node REPL, you can input JavaScript code into the Console tab and the V8 engine will execute it.

Let's try an example.

In the Chrome console,
invoke the function `alert` with an input string of `"Hello world!"`;

What effect does calling the `alert` function have?

Effect: It displays a modal dialog box (pop-up) at the top of the browser window containing your message ("Hello world!") and an "OK" button. The script execution pauses until you dismiss the alert.

Now try invoking the function `prompt` with a string input of `"What is your name?"` -

Effect: It opens a dialog box that includes a text input field, a message ("What is your name?"), and "OK"/"Cancel" buttons.

What effect does calling the `prompt` function have?
store the return value of your call to `prompt` in an variable called `myName`.

What is the return value of `prompt`?
It returns the string that the user typed into the input field. If the user clicks "Cancel", it returns null.
